This application allows the user to query three different APIs and view their results:

* Pictures via Giphy
* Movies via OMDB
* Bands via Bands in Town

The user chooses the API, types in a subject, and then clicks add. This creates a button that will call the given API and query for the subject entered. The user may add as many buttons as they like and click on them to see the query results.

If the user likes a particular result they can click on the Favorite button and it will create a copy of the result in the Favorites area. These results are persisted in local storage so they will remain on a page load or browser shutdown.

Bands have an added bonus of an active Facebook link.
